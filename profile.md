Full-time PhD student interested in theoretical and computational research focused on perovskite 
defects. I work with V.A.S.P. (computational software) to analyze and tune the electronic structure of
halide perovskites (HaP) according to our research of interest. The goal is to make efficient and stable 
HaP to serve commercial applications. On the other hand, equivalent efforts are made to understand 
the facilitating mechanism of charge transport possible due to the halogen bonding in the Layered 
perovskites (L.P.K.s). It will help overcome the charge transportation problem across the interlayers, 
resulting in the enhanced optoelectronic properties of LPKs
I am honest, hardworking, straightforward in communication, and ready to make a profit for my 
prospective organization. I believe in commitment to continuous learning and professional 
development in the topic of interest.
Core Skills

Summer and Semester projects
• Assisted with Prof. Aloke Das in computational studies of sulfur-centered unconventional 
hydrogen bonding at IISER-Pune. I studied extremely unconventional hydrogen bonding, 
where both the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms are less electronegative sulfur atoms,
using Gaussian09 software.In-depth understanding of these interactions can help design
efficient supramolecular assemblies, drugs, catalysts etc.
• Assisted Prof. Argha Banerjee in calculating the melt rate of the Satopanth glacier 
by using the Glaciological Mass Balance Method at IISER-Pune. (With the use of 
M.A.T.L.A.B., AWK ).In this project, I studied different glaciers around the world and how 
global warming has an impact on retreating the glaciers.
• Assisted with Prof. Balanarayan in theoretical chemistry (learned FORTRAN and used it for
Quantum chemistry-related problems) at IISER-Mohali. I studied the basics of coding and 
practiced a lot of programs and subroutines used in solving problems related to quantum 
chemistry.
• Assisted with Prof. Prasenjit Ghosh in computational material chemistry. (Application of 
Density Functional Theory in solid-state chemistry) at IISER-Pune. I studied the basics of 
density functional theory (DFT) and then performed calculations to obtain the structural and 
electronic properties of some simple solids and gas molecules. I also studied 
insulators/semiconductors (e.g., Si) and metals (e.g., Al, Cu) and explored the properties of 
oxygen molecules. For calculation purposes, I used the Quantum Espresso software.
Master’s Project
▪ Pursued MS-Thesis on photocathodic materials for P.E.C. water splitting under Prof. Ch. 
Subrahmanyam at IIT-Hyderabad. P.E.C. water splitting is an efficient approach since hydrogen 
and oxygen gases can be quantified easily and can help solve the significant problems that the 
world is facing today, which are the energy crisis and environmental pollution. There is a vast 
amount of work already done in the photoanodic system, but there is much to do for the 
photocathodic materials, which is worth exploring. I am working on chalcogenide materials as 
photocathodes because they are earth-abundant, cost-effective, and have good absorption power.
Ph.D. Project (Ongoing)
▪ Fossil fuels dominate energy consumption worldwide, resulting in many energy and environmental 
problems. In recent years, halide perovskites (HaP) have gained enormous attention in 
photovoltaic research due to their direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, and long lifetime of 
photogenerated carriers. Defects in perovskites are responsible for most problems and must be 
investigated thoroughly. Understanding the defect behavior experimentally is challenging as HaP 
forms soft-lattice crystals, resulting in the dynamical lattice, ease of lattice 
compression/expansion, and defect diffusion. A theoretical investigation using the first principal 
calculation plays a vital role in understanding defect properties at the atomic level, and this is our 
part of the research.
