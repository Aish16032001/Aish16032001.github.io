# Research student

Full-time PhD student interested in theoretical and computational research focused on perovskite defects. I work with V.A.S.P. (computational software) to analyze and tune the electronic structure of halide perovskites (HaP) according to our research of interest. The goal is to make efficient and stable HaP to serve commercial applications. On the other hand, equivalent efforts are made to understand the facilitating mechanism of charge transport possible due to the halogen bonding in the Layered perovskites (L.P.K.s). It will help overcome the charge transportation problem across the interlayers, resulting in the enhanced optoelectronic properties of LPKs.
I am honest, hardworking, straightforward in communication, and ready to make a profit for my prospective organization. I believe in commitment to continuous learning and professional development in the topic of interest.

### Master’s Project

* Pursued MS-Thesis on photocathodic materials for P.E.C. water splitting. It is an efficient approach since hydrogen and oxygen gases. There is a vast amount of work already done in the 
  photoanodic system, but there is much to do for the photocathodic materials, which is worth exploring. I worked on chalcogenide materials as photocathodes because they are earth- 
  abundant, cost-effective, and have good absorption power.
  
### Ph.D. Project

* Fossil fuels dominate energy consumption worldwide, resulting in many energy and environmental problems. In recent years, halide perovskites (HaP) have gained enormous attention in 
  photovoltaic research due to their direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, and long lifetime of photogenerated carriers. Defects in perovskites are responsible for most problems 
  and must be investigated thoroughly. Understanding the defect behavior experimentally is challenging as HaP forms soft-lattice crystals, resulting in the dynamical lattice, ease of 
  lattice compression/expansion, and defect diffusion. A theoretical investigation using the first principal calculation plays a vital role in understanding defect properties at the 
  atomic level, and this is our part of the research.
